                <p>Total Knee Joint Replacement (TKR) revision surgery is an orthopaedic surgical procedure in which the prosthetic pieces(s) of the previous TKR surgery are removed. New prosthetic pieces are then replaced within the knee joint. The components consist of the femoral condyle component, the tibial plateau component, the polyethylene spacer and the patella component. All or some of these may be replaced depending on the reason for replacement.</p>
                <p>Revisional TKR surgery is a more complicated operation requiring longer time in theater and rehabilitation is slower and takes a more cautious approach.
