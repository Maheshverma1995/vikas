                <p>Arthroscopic Meniscus Repair: Minimally invasive surgery to repair torn knee cartilage</p>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  Arthroscopic meniscus repair is an outpatient surgical procedure to repair torn knee cartilage. The torn meniscus is repaired by a variety of minimally invasive techniques and requires postoperative protection to allow healing. Physical therapy is useful to regain full function of the knee, which occurs on average 4-5 months after surgery.
                </p>
                <h3>Symptoms of Torn Meniscus
                </h3>
                Torn knee cartilage generally produces pain in the region of the tear and swelling in the knee joint. These symptoms are made worse with pivoting motions, squatting, and vigorous activities. Torn meniscus fragments can get caught in the knee joint and cause catching sensations. If a large enough fragment becomes lodged between the bearing surfaces, the knee may ‘lock’ and become unable to be fully bent or extended.


                <h3>Goal of Arthroscopic Meniscus Repair
                </h3>
                <p>The goal of meniscus surgery is to preserve healthy meniscus tissue. A meniscus tear requires a blood supply to heal. Only the outer third portion of the meniscus has blood supply to enable healing of a tear. Repairs are generally limited to this peripheral region of the meniscus. Many types of meniscus tears occur in the region of the meniscus without adequate blood supply for healing. Meniscus removal is generally recommended for tears to regions of the meniscus without blood supply. Please see arthroscopic meniscectomy for more information.

                </p>
                <h3>Surgical Options for Torn Meniscus
                </h3>
                <p>Meniscus tears can be treated by meniscus removal (meniscectomy), meniscus repair, or in unusual circumstances, meniscus replacement. Since the goal of surgery is to preserve healthy meniscus, meniscus repair is attempted when the tear is repairable. Meniscectomy, removal of the damaged meniscus tissue, has good short term results but leads to the development of arthritis ten to twenty years later. Meniscus repair also has good results, but has a longer recovery time than meniscectomy and is limited to tears which are amenable to repair. Meniscus replacement is considered for young, active patients who have previously had most of their meniscus removed, and develop pain in the area without having advanced degenerative changes to the articular (gliding surface) cartilage. Please see meniscus replacement for additional information.

                </p>              <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>When performed by an experienced surgeon, meniscus repair is highly successful , with good results in approximately 90% of patients. Any knee that is injured has a higher likelihood of developing arthritis. A successful repair slows the development of arthritic changes. Factors associated with higher rates of meniscus healing include repair within 2 months, more peripheral tear location, and concomitant ACL reconstruction.

                </p>
                <h3>Possible benefits of arthroscopic meniscus repair
                </h3>
                <p>The meniscus is an important structure for load transmission and shock absorption in the knee. The knee is subjected to up to 5 times body weight during activity, and half this force is transmitted through the meniscus with the knee straight, and 85% of the force goes through the meniscus with the knee bent ninety degrees. Loss of the meniscus increases the pressure on the articular (gliding) cartilage, which leads to degenerative changes. A successful meniscus repair preserves meniscus tissue and mitigates these changes.

                </p>
                <h3>Who should consider arthroscopic meniscus repair?
                </h3>
                <p>Even though the recovery is longer for a meniscus repair than for a meniscectomy, any repairable meniscus should generally be repaired. Meniscus repair is considered when:</p>



                <li>the patient is healthy and wishes to remain active</li>

                <li>the patient understands the rehabilitation, and accepts the risks of surgery

</li>

                <li>Moderate or severe knee pain while resting, either day or night</li>

                <li>The meniscus tear is located in the periphery of the meniscus</li>

                <li>the meniscus tissue is of good quality</li>
                <li>the surgeon is experienced in meniscus repair</li>
