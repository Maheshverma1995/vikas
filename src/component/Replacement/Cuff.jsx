              <h2>Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Injuries
</h2>
             <p>People of all ages injure their rotator cuffs. Some are good candidates for surgery, while others will pursue different treatments.

</p>
<p>You can injure your rotator cuff through wear and tear or poor movement patterns over time. Slouching and chronically pushing your head forward are two movement patterns that put your rotator cuffs at risk. As you get older, the rotator cuff can be irritated or pinched by calcium deposits in your shoulder area or bone spurs due to arthritis.

</p>
<p>Repetitive stress is another culprit. Tennis players, swimmers, and baseball pitchers are at risk for repetitive stress injuries of the shoulder, as are carpenters and painters.

</p>
<p>Rotator cuff injuries vary. Your tendons may be inflamed from overuse, or partially or fully torn. You may also feel pain in your shoulder from bursitis. This is a condition in which the bursa, a sac filled with fluid that sits between your rotator cuff and your shoulder joint, becomes inflamed and irritated.

</p>
              <h3>Symptoms of a rotator cuff injury include:

              <p> shoulder weakness
