              <h2>What is hip replacement surgery?</h2>
              <p>
              Hip replacement is highly successful surgery in which portions of the hip joint are replaced with prostheses (implants).
              </p>
              <p>Hip replacement is the removal and replacement of portions of the pelvis and femur (thighbone) that form your hip joint. It is performed primarily to relieve hip pain and stiffness caused by hip arthritis.</p>
              <p>
This procedure is also sometimes used to treat injuries such as a broken or improperly growing hip, and for other conditions.</p>
              <h3>How do you know if you need a hip replacement?</h3>
              <h6>If you have these arthritis symptoms, you should consider a hip replacement:</h6>
              <p>severe hip pain that is not relieved by medication and that interferes with your work, sleep or everyday activity hip stiffness that restricts motion and makes it difficult to walk
              </p>
              <h3>Hip Anatomy</h3>
              <p>The hip is a ball-and-socket joint. The ball, at the top of your femur (thighbone) is called the femoral head. The socket, called the acetabulum, is a part of your pelvis. The ball moves in the socket, allowing your leg to rotate and move forward, backward and sideways.</p>
              
              <p>In a healthy hip, soft-tissue called cartilage covers the ball and the socket to help them glide together smoothly. If this cartilage gets worn down or damaged, the bones scrape together and become rough. This condition, osteoarthritis, causes pain and restricts motion. An arthritic hip can make it painful to walk or even to get in or out of a chair. If you have been diagnosed with hip arthritis, you may not need surgery. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or physical therapy may provide relief. But, if these efforts do not relieve symptoms, you should consult an orthopedic surgeon.</p>
              <h3>What are the different types of hip replacement surgery?</h3>
              <li>partial hip replacement</li>

                <li>total hip replacement (most common)</li>

                <li>hip resurfacing</li>
              <p>The most common type of hip replacement surgery is called a total hip replacement (also called total hip arthroplasty). In this surgery, worn-out or damaged sections of your hip are replaced with artificial implants. The socket is replaced with a durable plastic cup, which may or may not also include a titanium metal shell. Your femoral head will be removed and replaced with a ball made from ceramic or a metal alloy. The new ball is attached to a metal stem that is inserted into the top of your femur.</p>
