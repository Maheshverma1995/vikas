              <h3>Surgery for impingement syndrome :
</h3>
              <p>Damaged or inflamed tissue is cleaned out in the area above the shoulder joint. A ligament called the coracoacromial ligament may be cut. The underside of a bone called the acromion may be shaved. A bony growth (spur) on the underside of the acromion often causes impingement syndrome. The spur can cause inflammation and pain in your shoulder.

</p>
             
              <p>At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and the repairs that were made.

</p>
<p>Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.
